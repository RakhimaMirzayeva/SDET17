logical operators:
logical operators helps combine multiple conditions on the same line in if statements.
There are 3 types of logical operators NOT(!) OR(||) AND(&&)
NOT(!):True=>false
        False=>true
        apply NOT operations when you want the opposite of the condition
        Only works with boolean
Why should we use NOT operators:
1) It can help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
2) Code readability will in increase.
OR(||):
this or that, either condition
Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple conditions in such a way that as soon as one
condition gets true the whole condition will
be evaluated true.
true||false||true=>true
false||false||false=>false
true||true||true=>true
AND(&&):
logical AND operator will help us combine the conditions in such a way that it will only give
 us true if all conditions are true.
 true && false&&true=>false
 true && true && true=>true
 true && true &&true=>false
