Operators:
operators are symbols which perform and operation on data. There are many
different types of operators in Java.

ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:

These operators help us perform simple mathematical operations like
Addition    => +    int a=10  int b=20  int c=a+b;  =>30
Subtraction   => -
Multiplication  => *
Division => /
Modulus  => %

SHORTHAND OPERATORS:

They help us perform Mathematical operations but using a little shorthand syntax.
add and  update the variable  =+  int a=10 a+=20  => 30
subtract and update the variable  -= int a=10 a-=20 => -10
Multiply and update the variable *= int a=10 a*20 => 200
Divide and update the variable /= int a=10 a/20 =>0
Modulus and update the variable %= int a=10  a%20  => 10

RELATIONAL OPERATORS:

These operators help us compare things.
== checks if two objects are equal.
!=  checks if two objects are NOT equal
> Greater than
< Less than
>= Greater than equal
<= Less than equal

 LOGICAL OPERATORS

 They help us combine multiple boolean conditions.
 There are three main logical operators in Java.
 ! NOT
 || OR
 && AND
&& = (AND) both conditions must be true
| | = (OR) either condition must be true( 1 true condition will be enough for
the entire condition to be true).
! = (NOT) reverses boolean value of condition
EX: boolean cond=true;
sout"!cond";


 INCREMENT/DECREMENT OPERATORS:

 ++ these will help us increase the value of a variable by one(1)
 -- these will help us decrease the value of a variable by one(1)


 NOTE:
 WWHILE LOOP:
 Checks the condition first then executes the code.
 DO WHILE on the other hand executes the code first and then checks the condition.
  Sometimes when we write the logic using do while it becomes easier. There are no other differences and reason to
  use a do while instead of while.
