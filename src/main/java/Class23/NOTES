Abstraction:
    Abstractions is the process of hiding implementation details and showing only the functionality
    to the end user.
We use the abstract keyword with methods to avoid the implementation details.

Why should we use Abstraction:
    1)Flexibility( if we don't know or  want to provide the implementation to the method we can skip it).

 Rules:
 1) We can not create the objects of the abstract classes.
 2) All the child classes must provide the implementation to the abstract methods which are coming from parent
 or mark the child class also abstract.
 3) An abstract class can have full body methods as well as abstract method.
 4) We can have instance or static field in a an abstract class
 5) Constructors are also allowed.
