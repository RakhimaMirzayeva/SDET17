Access modifiers:
    Access modifiers are keywords in java that help us control the access of
    instance and static variables they can also be used to control
    the access of methods and classes. There are four access levels
    and there are three keywords in java to apply these  access levels.
    --Private
    --Protected
    --Default
    --Public
NOTE: Best Practices:
    Instance Variables/fields/properties/attributes are Private 99% of the time.
 99% of the times Constructors are Public, because we want other to go over to constructor
 field and initialized it.
 90% of the times methods are Public
 8% private and rest of the time they are default or protected.
