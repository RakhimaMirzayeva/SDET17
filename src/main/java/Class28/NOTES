MAPS:
Maps is data structure which we can store key and value.
    Maps are dataStructures which stores key value pairs. There are many different types
    in java but we will be discussing:
    1)HashMap
    2)LinkedHashMap
    3) TreeMap
    4) HashTable(old one, not very useful)
 Maps are NOT part of the collection framework. Map is the name of the interface, and HashMap
 and linkedHashMap, TreeMap and HashTable are the classes that implement this interface
Why we should learn about Maps?
    All the other data structures that we have learned can only store one value at the time and
    they are index based. Maps allow us to store key value pairs which makes them a better choice
    because we know what we are storing.
Syntax of Maps:
    nameOfTheClass<DataType,DataTypeOfValue> variableName=new NameOfTheClass<>();--->>that the only difference
   HashMap<String,double> name=new HashMap<>();
    ArrayList<String> names=new ArrayList<>();
