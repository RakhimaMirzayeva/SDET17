    Methods/Functions/Behaviors/Routines
methods are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed.
when we call a methods
    There are two main types of methods:
    1) Methods which do not return any data(void types)
    2) Methods which can return data like in double char etc
    Syntax:

     dataType methodName (dataType nameOfParameters, dataType nameOfParameters){
     this is where we write the logic
     int add(int num1, int num2){
          int result=num1+num2;
                  System.out.println(result);
              return result;
              }
     int=>return type of method
     add=>name of the method
     int num1, int num2=>parameters
      {   =>>>> Body of the method
               int result = num1+num2
     {
       int result=num1+num2;
            System.out.println(result);
                    return result;
                                  }

     String Builder is Mutable which means==Changeable
     String builder is not good for saving memory because its going to create a new string
     that is why its fast, but not efficient because it uses a lot of memory.
   String(Immutable) is best for saving memory, but its slow, because it makes a searches in the
   program(looking if we have that information in the system already, and
   if we do it will bring that info).
