String Class:
    String class is designed to store symbols(letterA,b,C), numbers(10,12),
    Special character($,#,%) in form of a group. There are many methods already
    written by Java developer that we can just use.
    This is the most widely used class in Jva.
For Example:
    startsWith()
    endsWith()
    contains()
Why we should learn about this class.
1)Very important for coding questions
2)Most widely used class in all java.
3)Most of the information in real life is present in the form of Strings.

    Method Changing:
    When multiple methods are being called on the same line its called method changing
    String claas supports methond changing, for method changing to work previous
    method must return the expected datatype fo rthe next method.
    For example:
 String str="  Batch 17 is Great.   ";
        System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().trim().replace("great","Good"));




    NOTE:
