Collection Framework:
    Its a collection of classes and interfaces which help us build dynamic programs which are
    capable of handling of large amount of data.
  *Collection Frameworks doesn't work on the primitive dataTypes
Why should we learn about Collection Framework?
    Arrays are not good and we need something that is dynamic and more flexible, For example
    1) they are fixed in size.
    2) No ready made methods we have to create our own.
ArrayList:
    Better version of Arrays. It is also index based. Its dynamic we don't need to provide the
    size before hand and it contains a lot of methods to manipulate
    the data inside it.

 Syntax:
    For Arrays we used this syntax
    ***DatType[] nameOfArray=new DataType[size];***FOr Array
    ***String [] arr=new String[5];***For String
    ***ArrayList<DataType> nameForArrayList=new ArrayList<>();***
    ***ArrayList<String> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();***
 Methods From ArrayList:
    Size()=> Number of elements.
    add(element)=> adds new element to the arraylist
    get(index)=>Returns the element on specified index.
    remove(element)=> removes the element on the arrayList.
    indexOf(element)=> Returns the index of the element.
    contains(element)=> returns true if element is present otherwise false.
