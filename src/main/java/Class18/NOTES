Constructor:
    Constructors help us create the objects from the classes in a more secure and neat way. We can also put any
    piece of code that we want to execute when the object of a class is created.

  Why we should use Constructor?

    1) Mutable. They help use write more secure classes.
    2) Cleaner code
    3) More control over the values that we can assign to teh instance fields
    Syntax"

        1)Usually  public access modifiers
        2) Same name as class name
        3)No return type not even void
        4) Parameters
        5) Body of the constructor

    Never create method with a class name, when you use word void  it becomes method
    with a return type.
This Keyword doesn't work with static variables

    Create Cat class define 6 fields create  multiple constructors to give flexibility to the
    end user. PrintInfo method as well to print all the details
    of a cat.

    In any classes if you access other packages just type
    Import.classPackage.className

    *Static belongs to the class
    *Instance belongs to the object
