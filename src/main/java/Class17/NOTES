Constructors:
    Constructors helps us to build object from classes easily.

Constructors always have the same name as a class name,
and they don't have void.
Methods have a return type, and can have any name.
Constructors don't have a return type, and supposed to have the same name.
They help us to give initial values to the instance fields.The name of the constructor must be same as
class name. Constructors do not have any return types.
Most of the time constructors are public. Other than initializing the values we can have whatever
type of code inside the constructor that we like fox example calling methods writing if-else etc.
    Class ClassName{
     String name;
    public ClassName(){

    }
    public ClassName(String myName)//you can have more than 1 constructors

    }

    Instance field used to store Data.
