Encapsulation:
It is one of the four fundamental OOP
    1) Create classes to write code and store.
    2) Use private access modifiers to secure the data by limiting the access.
    3) Create "getter setter methods" for every fields.
Why should we learn about Encapsulation?
    It improves the control over data that we store in the fields of a class which
    leads us to more secure code.
Getter method===>to get method field
Setter method===>to set method field


Collection Frameworks:
    Collection frameworks in jave contains a lot of classes and interfaces.
    Which help us store and manipulate large amount of data easily and efficiently.
Why Collections Framework?
    Arrays have limitations
    1)they are fixed in size meaning once we provide the size we cannot change it afterwards.
      2) they don't have any built-in methods to help us process data.
