Method Overloading:(famous interview question)
    Method Overloading happens when multiple methods with same name but with different parameters.
    1) Different number of parameters for example, min(2,3) min(4,5,6);
    2) Different dataType of methods print("Java") print(12);
    3) Different sequence/order of parameters print("Java",12),print(12,"Java");
 Why should we learn about method overloading:
1) Cleaner code
2) We don't need to come up with different method names

Syntax:
 class Calculator{
 int add(int a,int b){
 return a+b;
 }
double addDouble(double a,double b){
  return a+b;
 }
long addLong(long a,long b){
 return a+b;

 INTERVIEW QUESTION:
 what is the signature of the method
 public void add(double num1, int num2)
Answer: name of the parameters and parameters it self is the signature of the method
NOTE:
 *SIGNATURE of the method:
    method name+ its parameters are called signature of the method.
 *Header of the method:
    Header of a method includes signature + return type + access modifier

 **MethodOverriding:
    MethodOverriding happens when same name method is present in parent as well as is child
    class.
