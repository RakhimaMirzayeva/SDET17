Interfaces:
    Interfaces are like contracts/agreements. In which we define abstract methods which the classes have to implement.
 Interfaces specifically designed for abstraction classes.
 They can also have public static final variables.
 Why should we learn about interfaces?
 1) Specially designed for abstraction.
 2) Light weight as compared to abstract classes.
 3)We can achieve multiple inheritance in interfaces.
 4) There is no diamond problems when having multiple inheritance.
 5) Helps us to build things in a modular way can be used with classes even if they are not closely related.
6) We can have multiple inheritance as there is no Diamond problem.
7)We can implement keyword when we have to implement as interface.
