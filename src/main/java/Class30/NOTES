Types of Errors in Java:
    There are three main types of errors in java.
    1) Syntax errors/Compile Time errors
    2) Logical errors/Bugs (missed if condition, wrong data type)
    3) Run time Errors/Exceptions


  Syntax errors/Compile Time errors:
Example
int age=10;
age int=10;
IDE--->>integrated development environment
How to solve Syntax errors/Compile Time errors?
    1) Most of the time your IDE(integrated development environment) is going to help you
    2) Compiler will also generate an error with line numbers and explanations
    3) You can look for the rules of that language.
    ( IDEs typically provide a code editor, a compiler or interpreter and a debugger that the
    developer accesses through a unified graphical user interface)
    Logical errors occur when programs do not generate the expected outputs

How to fix these types of errors?
    we can use debugger to fix these types of errors
Runtime errors/Exceptions:
    Runtime errors or exceptions are unwanted events that disrupts the normal flow
    of the program.
