Inheritance:
    Inheritance allows one class to have all the properties and methods from another class,
except private members and constructors. We use Extends keyword.

Why should we learn about Inheritance:
1) Faster development
2)Saves memory
3)

Syntax:
    class Parent{

    }
    class Child extends Parent

 Rules:
 1)Private members are not accessible in child classes
 2)Constructor are also not available for child classes directly

//One small thing if changed in parent class it will cause problem/error in child class

 Type of Inheritance:
 1)Single
 2)Hierarchical
 3)MultiLevel
 4)Hybrid
 5)Multiple(It is not supported by java)
    1)Single Inheritance:
 Only one parent and only one child(Not very Common)
    2)Hierarchical Inheritance:
 One parent and multiple child
    3)MultiLevel Inheritance:
MultiLevel Inheritance happens whena class C inherits from B and B inherents
from A. It works from top to bottom but can not go up check A class
4)Hybrid


    5)Multiple Inheritance:
 Multiple parent classes and one child class(Multiple Inheritance not
 allowed in java meaning a class can not inherent from multiple classes at the same time.

Interview Question:

What is Diamond Problem in OOP?
The ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A,
 and a further class D inherits from both B and C, so that if there
 is a method in A that B and/or C has overridden, and D does not override
 it, it is unclear which version of the method D should inherit.
