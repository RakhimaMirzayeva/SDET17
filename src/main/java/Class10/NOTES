Nested Loops:
A nested loop is a loop inside another loop.
Nested Loops are used to solve complex problems in which we have nested data or we need to perform
nested iterations. We can nest a for loop inside a while loop or a for loop
inside another for loop.
Why Nested Loops?
A tester we will be needing them to read excel data.
we will be needing them to go through multiple pages and from each page we might want
to go through multiple items.

Syntax:
for(int i=0; i<=10; i++){
ARRAYS:
Arrays help us store multiple objects of the same type in just one variable. They are index based
datastructures. Every item that we store inside an arrays is assigned a number that number is called
index. Whenever we want to get any value from the arrya we provide that index.
Why use arrays?
We can use multiple variables as well to store multiple items but when the date is large
it almost impossible to handle the variables. Imagine we have to store the names of all the persons
living in a city.
Syntax:
There are two ways of creating an array.
1) Datatype[] nameOfArray={element1,element2,}
int[] ages={25,32,35}
2) DataType[] nameOfArray=new DatType[Size]
int [] ages=new int[5]
ages[0]=25;
ages[1]=32;
ages[2]=35;
