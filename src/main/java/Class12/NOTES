Object Oriented Programming.
Its just a way(sets of rules) of writing a code.
it basically helps us write large amount of code.
That is easier to change and manage.
There are other ways like functional programming and procedural programming.

 Why would we should use OOP?
 1). It helps us write large amount of code easily.
 2) It also helps us represent the world around us inside computers easily.
 3) Changing code becomes easier.
 4) Sharing code and collaboration becomes easier.

 Main concepts/Main Pillars of OOP:
 1) Classes and Objects
 2) Inheritance.(Nasledovanie)
 3) Polymorphism
 4) Abstraction
 5) Encapsulation

 Classes and Objects:
    A Class its like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we start building
    the actual object. Classes have properties/attributes which helps us to figure out
    how something looks like and they have behavior/function which helps us understand how something works.
When we use loops - when we want to repeat a block of code
when we do not know the exact number of iterations use while or do while for this.
when we know how many times we want to repeat or iterate the code-- use for loop
