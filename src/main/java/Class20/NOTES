Super Keyword:
    Super keyword is used to access things from the parent class.
 We can access instance variables, methods, and constructors.

 Why should we learn about Super?
    1) Without Super() we can't call the constructor from the parent class
and we might have to repeat that constructor in all of the classes and
if someone declares fields private we would no be able to access the
field in child classes.
    2) We can use super to call the fields from the parent class if we have
 same name fields in the child class.

 Rules:
    1) When we use super() we must call at least one constructor from the parent
    class. because java needs at least one constructor from parent as it always first creates
    the object of the parent class when we create the object of the child class.
    2) When we have same name field as local instance and in the parent class as well.
    Java prefers local first then the instance of the same class then the instance of
    the parent class. However if we directly want to access the field from the parent we can use super keyword.
Default--anyone within the same package can access
Private --no one can access
Public--everyone can access anywhere
Protected--only accessible in child class





    Inheritance-its one of the main pillar of OOP.
Inheritance allows one class to have all the properties and methods from another
 class, thus allowing us to call those methods.
