What is File?
    Files are entities/objects that we use to store data permanently.
File Handling:
    Reading/writing/managing the files using code is called fileHandling
 As A Tester:
    You will use .properties file Excel files sometimes .csv files as well as
    we store configuration related data in .properties file for example usernames
    passwords urls the name of the browser on which you want to perform testing.
What data we store in excel files?
    1)we store the result of testing.
    2) we store the data related to web forms inside excel. It is done when we need a lot
    of data to test a website. It is called Data Driven Testing
Steps to work with a file:
    1)location/path on the computer.
    2)Bring the data from a file into RAM.
    3) Specific software/classes which understands how that file works.


        String path = "C:\Users\Syntax\IdeaProjects\JavaSdetBatch17\Files\Config.properties";

        try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(path)) {
            Properties properties = new Properties();
            properties.load(fis);
            System.out.println(properties.getProperty("browser"));


        } catch (IOException io) {
            System.out.println("Please check the file that you are trying to read");
            //send an email/report to the team
            //having a backup code like create new file if the one from above path is not found.
        }
