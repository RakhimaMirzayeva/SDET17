SuperKeyword:
    Super Keyword refers to parent class. We can use super-keyword to access variables,
     methods and constructors from the parent class
Why we should use super keyword:
    1) To specifically call something from parent class. like a variable or method
    2) We can use super() to call constructor from parent.
Method Overloading:
    1) When we have same method with different  parameters its called method overloading.
    2) We can change the count of the parameter. we can overload methods as well as constructor.
    3)We can also change the datatype of parameters if number of parameters are same.
    4) we can change the sequence if datatype and number of parameters are same.

 Why?
 1) Cleaner code. we don't have to come up with different method name.
 2) Reuse: same name can be reused many times.
======================================================================
MethodOverriding:
    When same method is present in parent as well as child class. its called
    method overriding. When we ovveride a method Java prefers the method from the child class.
Why?
