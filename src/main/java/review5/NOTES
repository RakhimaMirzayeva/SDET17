What is Object oriented programming(OOP)
    Its simply a way of writing code. Some rules that we follow.
    There are other ways as well as like functional programming, procedural programming.
    There are 4 main pillars of OOP:
    1)Inheritance
    2)Polymorphism(Many forms, shapes)
    3)Abstraction(you write partial code)
    4)Encapsulation(private)
Why should we learn OOP:
    1)Code re-usability
    2)Its easier to write large amounts of code
    3)sharing code with others become easier
    4)Security of the code increased
    5)Changing code becomes easier
Object:
    An object is something that we can physically touch and see. Everything around us like
    chairs, tables, mouse, phone, cup is an object. They are all objects. We can easily represent
    these objects inside our computers by telling a computer how an object looks like
    and how it behaves.
  *Methods tells us about the actions(things that they can do)

Class:
    A class is like a design/map/blueprint that we use to create objects.
String Class:
    A String class is used to store and manipulate text based data.
    Most of the information inside computers is processed in this form.
    String is the most widely used class in all Java.
Creating objects from String class:
    1)Length
    2)isEmpty(returns boolean)and checks if string has any letters or empty
    3)

Public, Private--Access Modifiers

*Instance Variable--created outside of any variable but inside of the class
*Static methods don't require using an object
