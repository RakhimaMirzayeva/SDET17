ctrl + O will write all override for me



MethodOverriding:
    When we have exact same methods in parent and child class, we call it Method Overriding.
 Why should we learn about method overriding?
    Method Overriding gives us a lot of flexibility, for example, if we don't like method from parent
    class we can overriding.
 Syntax:
    class Parent{
    void eat(){
    sout"Fish"
    }
    }
    class Child extends Parent{
    void eat(){
    sout "Chicken"
    }
    }
Parents class is always larger class then Child class, so you can store multiple child classes
in parent clas but not multiple parent classes in child class.

Overriding is dynamic polyMor
