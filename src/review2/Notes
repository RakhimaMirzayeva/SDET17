Type Casting
Type casting is converting data from one datatype to another datatype.
for example:we can convert an integer to float or another way around.
There are two types of type casting
1) Implicit/Auto/widening
2) Explicit/manual/narrowing
IF STATEMENTS;
if statements are parts of the conditional constructs in Java
write code that can be executed based on a condition.
There are many variation of if statements 1)if, 2)if-else, 3)else-if, 4)Nested if
Why we need conditional statements?
without the If statement programs will always generate the same output no matter what.
Syntax:
if(condition){
something that we want to execute if condition is true
} else{
something that we want to execute if condition is false
  primitive use (==),<>,!=, etc.
  nonprimitive like String use(day.equals()) {

  note:
  whenever it is possible to write code with else-if and multiple if conditions alwasy go with else-if statements.
