NESTED LOOPS:

A loop inside another loop, just like if statements.
We can nest any type of loop.
Why do we need them?
To solve complex problems that requires accessing execess data.
Nested Loops
Outer loop will print for lines
inner loop for colums

ARRAYS:
Is  a data structure that helps us store multiple items in a single variable.
 We can use the indexes to access these values.
 Arrays are data structures that help us store large amounts of similar data.
 Indexes always start from zero.
 Why should we use arrays?
 Arrays help us store and manipulate large amounts of data easily with the help of loops
 Whenever we have more than 3 similar items that we can to store and process together we should
 always go with arrays.

 Syntax:
 There are two ways of creating the arrays
 Method1:
 Data Type[] nameOfTheArray={element1,element2,element3}
 Method2:
 DataType[]nameOfTheArray=new  DataType{Size]

Enhanced For Loop:
Enhanced For Loop is used to iterate through data structures which have multiple
items stored inside them.
Why should we use Enhanced For Loop:
Because its simple, and easy to understand.
SYntax:
for(DataTypeOfElement anyVariableName:NameOfTheDataStructure){

Limitations:
1. Enhanced For Loop can't be used for updating the elements.
2. Access the elements in the reverse order etc.

BREAK:
Break keyword is used in switch cases statements and with the loops to
terminate the loop prematurely.
Why should we use break keyword?
using break keyword can help save a lot of processing time and our code can execute faster.

CONTINUE: U Turn Sign
is used to skip the code from a loop once we hit the skip keyword Java
ignores the rest of the code in the loop and jumps to the next iteration.
